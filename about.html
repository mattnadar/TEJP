        <p>The Environmental Justice Project is a hybrid social justice and environmental-based RSO aiming to educate UD about environmental injustices, especially in marginalized, underrepresented, and vulnerable communities. We also strive to give our members the tools and knowledge to help support these afflicted communities in an effective and respectful way.</p>

        <div class="definition">
            The EPA defines environmental justice as: <br>
            "the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all 

            people regardless of race, color, national origin, or
            
            income, with respect to the development, 
            
            implementation, and enforcement of environmental 
            
            laws, regulations, and policies."

            <p>One of the primary ways we strive to help vulnerable communities is through <a href="#grants">grants</a> which are governmental or private funds allocated to groups to fund projects and public services. Communities can use this money to fund anything from restoration projects to improving or creating institutions.
